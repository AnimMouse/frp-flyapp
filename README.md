# frp on fly.io
[Fast reverse proxy](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) on [fly.io](https://fly.io)

Run your own frp tunnel for free (within free tier) on fly.io

> [!NOTE]
> On 2024, fly.io will now charge $2/mo for a dedicated IPv4 address, but everything under $5 bill monthly is waved, so if you have 2 or fewer dedicated IPv4, it is still free.

Now you can have ngrok TCP/UDP tunnel with the ports you want, not randomly generated ports on ngrok unless you [pay monthly](https://ngrok.com/pricing).

## fly.io Deployment
### GitHub Codespaces

1. Fork this repository.
2. On your own fork, click Code, and click Codespaces tab.
3. Click "Create codespace on main".
4. Check if frp version in `Dockerfile` is latest, if not, change to the latest version.
5. Login to flyctl by using `fly auth login` or you can generate [access tokens](https://fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens) and paste it to `FLY_API_TOKEN` in Codespaces secrets.
6. Create an app on fly.io `fly launch --copy-config --name <app-name> --no-deploy`.
7. When asked to tweak these settings before proceeding, enter yes if you want to tweak settings like selecting the region closest to you, otherwise, enter no.
8. Set environment variables for frp server. `fly secrets set -a <app-name> FRP_TOKEN=12345678 FRP_DASHBOARD_PWD=admin`
9. Deploy to fly.io `fly deploy -a <app-name> --ha=false`.
10. When asked to allocate a dedicated IPv4 address, enter yes.
11. Try to connect to frps using the [example frpc.toml](#example-frpctoml).

### Local
You need [flyctl](https://github.com/superfly/flyctl) installed.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Check if frp version in `Dockerfile` is latest, if not, change to the latest version.
3. Login to flyctl by using `fly auth login`.
4. Create an app on fly.io `fly launch --copy-config --name <app-name> --no-deploy`.
5. When asked to tweak these settings before proceeding, enter yes if you want to tweak settings like selecting the region closest to you, otherwise, enter no.
6. Set environment variables for frp server. `fly secrets set -a <app-name> FRP_TOKEN=12345678 FRP_DASHBOARD_PWD=admin`
7. Deploy to fly.io `fly deploy -a <app-name> --ha=false`.
8. When asked to allocate a dedicated IPv4 address, enter yes.
9. Try to connect to frps using the [example frpc.toml](#example-frpctoml).

Don't forget to change the `<app-name>` and the `FRP_TOKEN` so that others can't use your frp tunnel.

You can also view `https://<app-name>.fly.dev` in your browser to view the frps dashboard.

## Change server configuration
Type `fly deploy -a <app-name>` on the repository after editing frps.toml

## Switch
fly.io runs app 24/7, if you are not using your tunnel for a while, it is recommended to suspend it to conserve free tier and resources.

* Suspend frp `fly scale count 0 -a <app-name>`
* Resume frp `fly scale count 1 -a <app-name>`

## Patched frp to support TCP and UDP tunnel
Since in fly.io, it is [required to bind to `fly-global-services`](https://fly.io/docs/networking/udp-and-tcp/#your-app-needs-to-bind-to-the-fly-global-services-address) in order for UDP to work, but frp's `proxyBindAddr` only allow to bind in one address, so we patched frp to make its UDP proxy to bind to `fly-global-services`.

If somehow frp diverged so much that the patch gets broken, just remove the patch on Dockerfile.

## Example frpc.toml
### KCP Protocol
[KCP](https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp/blob/master/README.en.md) (a protocol built on UDP) is used by default and to reduce latency (like for game servers).

```toml
serverAddr = "<app-name>.fly.dev"
auth.token = "12345678"

# KCP connection
serverPort = 7000
transport.protocol = "kcp"

# QUIC connection
#serverPort = 7001
#transport.protocol = "quic"

# TCP connection
#serverPort = 7000
#transport.protocol = "tcp"

# TCP tunnel
[[proxies]]
name = "Minecraft Java"
type = "tcp"
localIP = "127.0.0.1"
localPort = 25565
remotePort = 25565

# UDP tunnel
[[proxies]]
name = "Minecraft Bedrock"
type = "udp"
localIP = "127.0.0.1"
localPort = 19132
remotePort = 19132
```

### fly.io free tier
fly.io requires a credit card in order to work, if you don't have a credit card or if you are afraid that fly.io will charge you so much, it is recommended to buy prepaid credits that can be used with virtual credit cards.

### HTTP tunneling
If you are tunneling HTTP apps instead of TCP/UDP, I recommend to just use [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/).\
You can also tunnel HTTP apps on this frp by using a custom port like 8080.\
If you need to use standard 80 and 443 port, you need to disable the frps dashboard. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/AnimMouse/frp-flyapp/wiki/HTTP-Tunneling) for tutorial.

### IPv6 support
If you have IPv6, congratulations, [you don't need this tunnel](https://www.reddit.com/r/networkingmemes/comments/sif407/imagine_network_engineers_time_gone_into/).

To allocate IPv6 in fly.io: `fly ips allocate-v6 -a <app-name>`

To enable IPv6 in control plane, set `bindAddr = "::"` in frps.toml. Take note that KCP does not work in IPv6 as [`fly-global-services` does not support IPv6] so you would need to use TCP if you use IPv6 in control plane.

To enable IPv6 in data plane, set `proxyBindAddr = "::"` in frps.toml and `localIP = "::1"` in frpc.toml. Take note that UDP does not work in IPv6 as [`fly-global-services` does not support IPv6] so you can't tunnel UDP in IPv6.

[`fly-global-services` does not support IPv6]: https://fly.io/docs/networking/udp-and-tcp/#you-need-a-dedicated-ipv4-address
